## Overview
In MAE 4300, I examined the Boeing 737 MAX accidents as a case study in engineering ethics, focusing on how technical design decisions, organizational pressure, and regulatory structure interacted to produce a major safety failure. Rather than treating ethics as an abstract concept, this analysis approaches ethics as a core part of real engineering practice.

---

## Why This Case Matters
The 737 MAX failures highlight how modern engineering systems can fail even when individual components work as designed. In safety-critical systems, ethical responsibility extends beyond technical correctness to include system integration, human factors, training, and communication.

---

## Key Ethical Questions
- Should Boeing have required additional pilot training when introducing MCAS?
- Should MCAS functionality and risks have been more clearly disclosed to pilots and regulators?
- Was it ethical to certify a flight-critical system with single-sensor dependency?
- How should engineers respond when safety concerns conflict with cost, schedule, or competition?

These questions framed my analysis throughout Weeks 6–9 of the course.

---

## Technical and Organizational Context
From a technical standpoint, MCAS relied on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor and could repeatedly command nose-down stabilizer trim. Organizationally, Boeing faced intense competitive pressure and operated under a certification process that delegated significant authority to the manufacturer. Together, these conditions created an environment where safety-critical decisions were influenced by non-technical constraints.

## Ethical Analysis Using ASME Canons
Applying the ASME Code of Ethics revealed clear conflicts between public safety and organizational priorities. While efficiency, cost control, and market competitiveness are important considerations, ASME principles establish that public safety must always take precedence, especially in life-critical systems such as aviation.

Approving MCAS without redundancy, clear disclosure, or adequate pilot training violated this ethical hierarchy and placed pilots and passengers at unnecessary risk.

---

## Practical Constraints on Ethical Action
This case also demonstrates that ethical failures are rarely the result of a single individual. Engineers faced:
- job security concerns and organizational pressure  
- limited system-level visibility  
- regulatory ambiguity  
- siloed communication between engineering, management, and regulators  

Understanding these constraints is essential for designing systems that support ethical decision-making in practice.

---

## Prevention and Lessons Learned
Preventing similar failures requires action at multiple levels:

**Individual Level**
- stronger ethics training and escalation pathways  
- clear documentation and reporting standards  

**Organizational Level**
- independent safety review boards  
- mandatory pilot training for new automation  
- transparent communication across teams  

**Systemic Level**
- meaningful regulatory oversight  
- industry-wide standards for redundancy in flight-critical systems  

Ethical engineering cannot rely on individual courage alone; it must be embedded into system design and organizational structure.

---

## Personal Reflection
This case reinforced that ethics is not separate from engineering work. Design choices, training decisions, and communication strategies all carry ethical consequences. As a mechanical engineer interested in complex systems and product design, this analysis has shaped how I approach responsibility, particularly when safety, automation, and human interaction intersect.
